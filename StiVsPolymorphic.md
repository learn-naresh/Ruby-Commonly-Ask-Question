In Ruby on Rails, **STI (Single Table Inheritance)** and **Polymorphic Associations** are both ways to model relationships between objects, but they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 1. **STI (Single Table Inheritance)**

STI lets you store multiple **subclasses** in a **single database table**. It's used when subclasses share many common attributes and behavior.

### âœ… Use When:

* All subclasses share the same table schema.
* You want to use inheritance (`is-a` relationship).

### ðŸ§± Example: `Employee` subclasses

```ruby
# migration
create_table :employees do |t|
  t.string :name
  t.string :type  # STI discriminator column
  t.string :specialization
  t.timestamps
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/employee.rb
class Employee < ApplicationRecord
end

# app/models/manager.rb
class Manager < Employee
end

# app/models/developer.rb
class Developer < Employee
end
```

### âœ… Usage:

```ruby
Manager.create(name: "Alice", specialization: "HR")
Developer.create(name: "Bob", specialization: "Ruby")

Employee.all  # => returns both Manager and Developer objects
```

## ðŸ”· 2. **Polymorphic Association**

Allows a model to belong to **more than one other model** on a single association. Great when multiple models can be associated with the same kind of data.

### âœ… Use When:

* Different models need to share a relationship with a common model.
* You want a flexible `belongs_to` (`has-a` relationship).

### ðŸ§± Example: Comments on `Post` and `Photo`

```ruby
# migration
create_table :comments do |t|
  t.text :body
  t.references :commentable, polymorphic: true
  t.timestamps
end
```

```ruby
create_table :posts do |t|
  t.string :title
end

create_table :photos do |t|
  t.string :caption
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/comment.rb
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true
end

# app/models/post.rb
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, as: :commentable
end

# app/models/photo.rb
class Photo < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, as: :commentable
end
```

### âœ… Usage:

```ruby
post = Post.create(title: "Rails Tips")
photo = Photo.create(caption: "Sunset")

post.comments.create(body: "Great post!")
photo.comments.create(body: "Nice shot!")
```

## ðŸ”„ Key Differences

| Feature              | STI                          | Polymorphic Association                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Table structure      | One table for all subclasses | Separate tables, shared associations       |
| Use case             | `is-a` relationships         | `has-a` relationships                      |
| Flexibility          | Low (same schema required)   | High (different models can share relation) |
| Discriminator column | `type` column in table       | `*_type` and `*_id` columns                |
| Example              | `Manager < Employee`         | `Comment` belongs to `Post` or `Photo`     |
