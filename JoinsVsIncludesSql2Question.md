### ✅ ActiveRecord Query Example:

```ruby
Post.joins(:user).where(users: { name: "John" })
```

👉 **Joins** is used here to query posts that belong to a user named **John**.

---

### ⚡ Summary of Associations:

* **`joins`** = fast, efficient SQL JOIN.
* **`includes`** = eager loads associated records (may use JOIN or extra queries).
* **`left_outer_joins`** = includes all records even if association is `nil`.

🛑 **Always be careful with table names in `.where()`**

---

### 🔍 Difference Between `joins` and `includes`:

#### `joins`:

* Creates a SQL JOIN.
* Does **not** load associated objects into memory.
* Faster if you don’t need the associated object data.

#### `includes`:

* Eager loads associated objects.
* Solves **N+1** query problem.
* Might use JOIN or two queries internally depending on access pattern.

### 🧠 Self-referencing Association Example

```ruby
class Employee < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :manager, class_name: "Employee", optional: true
  has_many :subordinates, class_name: "Employee", foreign_key: "manager_id"
end
```

#### Setup:

```ruby
boss = Employee.create(name: "Big Boss")
employee = Employee.create(name: "Worker Bee", manager: boss)
```

#### Accessing Associations:

```ruby
boss.subordinates  # => [#<Employee name: "Worker Bee">]
employee.manager   # => #<Employee name: "Big Boss">
```

### 🌟 What is `includes` in Rails?

* Used for **Eager Loading** associations.
* Prevents the **N+1 Query Problem**.

#### 📌 Real-world Example:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

#### ❌ Without includes (N+1 Problem):

```ruby
users = User.all
users.each do |user|
  puts user.posts.count
end
```

👎 Results in **1 + N queries** (1 for users, N for posts per user)

#### ✅ With includes:

```ruby
users = User.includes(:posts)
users.each do |user|
  puts user.posts.count
end
```

🚀 Rails executes:

* `SELECT * FROM users;`
* `SELECT * FROM posts WHERE posts.user_id IN (...);`

✅ Only **2 queries**, no matter how many users.

#### 🛠 Full Example:

```ruby
users = User.includes(:posts)
users.each do |user|
  puts "User: #{user.name}"
  user.posts.each do |post|
    puts "  - #{post.title}"
  end
end
```

### 🔄 `joins` vs `includes` Summary Table:

| Feature                   | `joins`                      | `includes`                               |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Purpose                   | SQL join                     | Eager load associations                  |
| Loads associated objects? | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes                                    |
| Best for                  | Filtering/querying           | Avoiding N+1 when accessing associations |
| Performance               | Faster for simple conditions | Better when accessing related data       |

### 💼 SQL Queries

#### 1️⃣ **Second Highest Salary (SQL):**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1;
```

#### Ruby Equivalent:

```ruby
Employee.select(:salary).distinct.order(salary: :desc).offset(1).limit(1)
```

---

#### 2️⃣ **Employees whose salary is greater than their manager’s:**

##### SQL:

```sql
SELECT employees.*
FROM employees
INNER JOIN employees AS m ON employees.manager_id = m.id
WHERE employees.salary > m.salary;
```

##### Rails:

```ruby
Employee.joins(:manager).where('employees.salary > managers_employees.salary')
```
