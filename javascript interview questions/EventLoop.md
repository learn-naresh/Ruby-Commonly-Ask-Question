### 🔄 What is the **Event Loop** in JavaScript?

The **Event Loop** is a key part of JavaScript's **concurrency model**. It allows JavaScript — a single-threaded language — to handle **asynchronous operations** (like timers, API calls, or user interactions) **without blocking** the main thread.

---

## 🧠 Simply put:

> The **event loop** continuously checks the **call stack** and **task queue** — and moves tasks from the queue to the stack when the stack is empty.

---

## 📦 Core Components

### 1. **Call Stack**

Where functions are executed — one at a time (LIFO: last in, first out).

### 2. **Web APIs / Browser APIs**

Provided by the browser for async tasks like `setTimeout`, `DOM events`, `fetch`, etc.

### 3. **Callback Queue (Task Queue)**

Where async callbacks wait once the Web API finishes its job.

### 4. **Event Loop**

Keeps checking:
👉 "Is the **call stack empty**? If yes, move the **first callback** from the task queue into the call stack and run it."

---

## 🔁 Example Step-by-Step

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside timeout");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Start
End
Inside timeout
```

### ⚙️ What happened:

1. `"Start"` is logged.
2. `setTimeout` registers a callback with the **Web API**.
3. `"End"` is logged next.
4. After 0ms, the timeout callback moves to the **callback queue**.
5. Once the **call stack is empty**, the **event loop** pushes the callback onto the call stack.
6. `"Inside timeout"` is finally logged.

## 🧬 Visual Flow

```
Call Stack        Web APIs           Callback Queue
----------        ----------         ---------------
console.log()  →                    →
setTimeout()   →   (waits 0ms)   →  →  callback() →
console.log()  →                    →

Event Loop: keeps checking ⟳
```

## 💡 Important Notes

* **JavaScript is single-threaded** — only one task runs at a time.
* The **event loop** enables non-blocking behavior by deferring tasks to be handled **later**, once the stack is free.
* `setTimeout(fn, 0)` does **not** mean it runs immediately — it waits until the stack is clear.

---

## 🧪 Bonus: Microtasks vs Macrotasks

* **Microtasks**: Promises, `queueMicrotask`
* **Macrotasks**: `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, DOM events

🔄 Microtasks run **before** macrotasks in the queue.

```javascript
console.log("A");

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("B"));

setTimeout(() => console.log("C"), 0);

console.log("D");
```

### Output:

```
A
D
B
C
```

### **Definition of the Event Loop:**

The **Event Loop** in JavaScript is a mechanism that allows JavaScript (which is single-threaded) to handle **asynchronous operations** efficiently. It continuously monitors the **call stack** and the **callback queue**, moving functions from the queue to the stack when the stack is empty. This enables JavaScript to perform **non-blocking I/O** and execute tasks like `setTimeout`, `API calls`, or event handlers without freezing the entire program.

---

### **Detailed Explanation of the Event Loop:**

To explain the event loop thoroughly, let's break it down into its key components and steps:

---

### 1. **Single-Threaded Nature of JavaScript**

JavaScript runs on a **single thread**, meaning it can only execute one operation at a time. However, many tasks (like I/O operations, network requests, timers, etc.) are asynchronous, so JavaScript needs a way to handle these tasks without blocking the main thread.

* **Blocking** means the program would stop and wait for the task to complete before moving on to the next one.
* **Non-blocking** means JavaScript can initiate a task and move on to other tasks while waiting for the task to complete.

This is where the **event loop** comes into play.

---

### 2. **Components Involved**

#### 📍 **Call Stack**

* The **call stack** is where all the **synchronous** code gets executed.
* Functions are pushed onto the stack when called and popped off when they are finished.
* If the call stack is busy executing code, no other code can run until it finishes.

#### 📍 **Web APIs** (or Browser APIs)

* These are provided by the **browser environment** (or Node.js for server-side code) for handling asynchronous tasks like:

  * `setTimeout`
  * DOM events (like clicks or keypresses)
  * HTTP requests (`fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`)
  * Promises
* When you use these APIs, JavaScript offloads the task to these APIs and **continues executing other code**.

#### 📍 **Callback Queue** (or Task Queue)

* The **callback queue** is where asynchronous callbacks (functions) wait for the call stack to be empty before they are executed.
* Once the synchronous code finishes executing and the stack is empty, the event loop **pushes** the callback from the queue into the call stack.

#### 📍 **Event Loop**

* The **event loop** is responsible for continuously checking if the **call stack** is empty and, if so, moving the **first callback** from the **callback queue** to the call stack for execution.
* It runs **continuously** to ensure that all asynchronous tasks get executed in the right order without blocking the main thread.

### 3. **How It Works (Step-by-Step)**

Here’s the sequence of events that occur when a piece of asynchronous code is executed:

1. **Synchronous Code Execution**: JavaScript starts by executing **synchronous code** in the **call stack**.
2. **Asynchronous Task Initiated**: When it encounters an **asynchronous task** (e.g., `setTimeout`, API call, promise), it delegates this task to a **Web API**.
3. **Task Waiting in Callback Queue**: Once the asynchronous task finishes, its callback function is placed in the **callback queue** (task queue).
4. **Event Loop**: The **event loop** constantly checks whether the **call stack** is empty.
5. **Callback Execution**: When the call stack is empty, the event loop moves the **first callback** from the queue to the **call stack**, allowing it to be executed.

---

### 4. **Example (Code Walkthrough)**

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside timeout");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Start** is logged first because it’s synchronous and executed directly from the call stack.
2. `setTimeout` is called, and the callback (`() => console.log("Inside timeout")`) is handed off to the Web API (in this case, the browser's timer).
3. The **call stack** is now empty after logging **End**.
4. The **event loop** checks the callback queue. After 2 seconds, the callback from `setTimeout` is moved from the queue to the stack.
5. **Inside timeout** is logged last.

### Output:

```
Start
End
Inside timeout
```

---

### 5. **Microtasks vs. Macrotasks**

Tasks in JavaScript can be categorized into two types of queues: **microtasks** and **macrotasks**.

* **Macrotasks**: Tasks like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and most other events.
* **Microtasks**: Tasks like `Promises`, `queueMicrotask`.

#### 📌 **Important Rule**:

* **Microtasks** are always processed **before** macrotasks, even if the macrotask is already in the callback queue.

Example:

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Macrotask");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Microtask");
});

console.log("End");
```

### Output:

```
Start
End
Microtask
Macrotask
```

Here’s why:

* `setTimeout` creates a **macrotask**, and the promise `.then()` creates a **microtask**.
* The event loop first runs all microtasks (e.g., the promise callback) before running macrotasks.

---

### 6. **Key Points to Emphasize**

* **JavaScript is single-threaded**, so it can only execute one piece of code at a time.
* The **event loop** enables JavaScript to handle **asynchronous tasks** without blocking the main thread, making your web pages **responsive**.
* **Synchronous tasks** are executed first, while **asynchronous tasks** are handled later.
* Microtasks (like promises) have higher priority than macrotasks (like `setTimeout`).
* The **event loop** is what makes JavaScript seem "non-blocking" while still being single-threaded.

---

### **Visual Summary:**

```
1. Synchronous Code:
    - Executes on the Call Stack
    - E.g., console.log, regular function calls

2. Asynchronous Code:
    - Handled by Web APIs
    - E.g., setTimeout, fetch, event listeners

3. Callback Queue:
    - Waiting area for async callbacks

4. Event Loop:
    - Moves tasks from Callback Queue to Call Stack
    - Executes tasks when the Call Stack is empty
```

---

### **In Simple Terms for Teaching:**

You can describe the event loop as:

* **Imagine a worker in a factory** (the JavaScript engine) who can only work on one task at a time (the **call stack**).
* Whenever a task requires time (like waiting for a timer or fetching data), it gets handed off to someone else (the **Web APIs**).
* When the worker finishes all tasks and the factory floor is empty (the **call stack** is clear), the worker looks at a **queue** of tasks that were waiting for their turn.
* The worker picks up the next task in line from the queue and starts working on it.
